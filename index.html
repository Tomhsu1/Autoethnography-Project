        <p> My father and his family came to the United States to escape Communism and the rise of Mao Zedong in search of a better life. In this foreign land, they struggled to learn English and find employers who would hire them.</p>

        <p> Being born in America to Chinese parents, I struggled to find an identity. Growing up, I told myself that I was American, not Chinese. My thoughts were swayed by the misunderstanding of the differences between my ethnicity and my nationality. But sometimes I wish that I wasn't Chinese. I never realized the struggles and ignorance that came along with being Chinese. </p>
